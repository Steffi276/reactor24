\section{General situation}

Each participating group draw parts of the vacuum vessel, which represented their responsibilities of the project.
All these different CAD-files should be connected at the end, but due to the different background and knowledge in drawing 3D-models of the constructors, it was not possible to put all the parts togehther correctly and smoothly.
This document is a recipy for someone in the future, who has time,nerves and muse to draw the whole chamber including all parts necessary for the vacuum chamber, the coils, the diagnostics and the heating including all design restrictions in the correct way from a constructors view (building parts, building groups, ...).
Whoever will do this (I hope it is not me): I wish you good luck and nerves of steel.

Lovely Greetings,

Elli
